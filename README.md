# Jikan: Date and Time in Rust Beyond Just Georgian
Jikan is a Rust library for performing conversions of Georgian calendar dates into other calendar systems. It makes use of [Chrono](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono).

## About This Project
The name Jikan comes from *jikan*, or more properly 時間 or じかん, the Japanese word for time and is pronounced jeeKAHN, or [d͡ʑikã̠ɴ] in IPA. This name was chosen because the first calendar conversion Jikan is set to implement is Georgian calendar dates to dates that use the Japanese era calendar scheme. While this is being used as a starting point, the plan is for Jikan to eventually be expanded to cover other calendar systems, which is the reason a word meaning time was chosen rather than one specifically related to Japanese era names.

Jikan is being written by a one-member team as a final project for an undergraduate introductory Rust course. I want to be upfront in saying I don't have a lot of experience in Rust or library creation in general. That said, I'm going to do my best to turn this into a fully functional library that complies with Rust standards and best practices. I also welcome feedback and collaboration in the form of direct contact and forking and pull requests.
